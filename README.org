* RSTNPy

Library to work with RSTN 1 second data. Working for data after 2000.
The library provides the possibility of downloading the file for a
given day from any of RSTN stations, and it is also able to generate a
dataframe with the data.

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install rstnpy
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies

- pandas >= 0.21
- requests >= 2.20
- numpy >= 1.13
- matplotlib >= 2.2.2

** How to use it

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from rstnpy import RSTN

year = 2014
month = 10
day = 16
path_to_files = "data/"
station = "San vito"

rstn = RSTN(year, month, day, path_to_files, station)

# Search and download the file.
filename = rstn.downloader.download_file()

# Decompress the gzipped file into a text file.
filename = rstn.decompress_file(filename)

# Generate a dataframe from the data.
df = rstn.create_dataframe()

# Plot the data.
ax = rstn.plot()

plt.plot()
#+END_SRC

** Known issues

There is a bug when we download the file. The bug itself *does not*
*affect the functionality* as it is an ignored exception. It is a
apparently a tempfile bug.

Traceback example running with python 3.6.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
Exception ignored in: <bound method _TemporaryFileCloser.__del__ of <tempfile._TemporaryFileCloser object at 0x7f2ba52df320>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/tempfile.py", line 591, in __del__
    self.close()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/tempfile.py", line 584, in close
    self.file.close()
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'close'
#+END_SRC

** Compatibility

The library works with Python 3.5+
